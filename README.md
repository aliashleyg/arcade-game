## Game Play Instructions:
* Choose your diver.
* Use the arrow keys to move your diver.
* Avoid the sea creatures; if you touch one, you will have to start again.
* Touch the boat. If you are still within the 60 seconds of game play, you will have another opportunity to reach the boat.
* Continue playing until the game ends. 

## Scoring
The goal of the game is to get from the ocean floor to the boat without getting attacked by sea creatures as many times as you can before the timer ends the game at 60 seconds.

* The timer begins once your character is chosen and the modal window closes.
* You (the diver) get a point each time you make it safely to the boat.
* The sea creatures get a point each time they attack (touch) you.

## Additional Gameplay Information
* Once the time has expired, you will be presented with a summary of the game: how you did versus how the sea creatures did. 
* You will be presented with the opportunity to play again and better your score. 

## About the Game
This game was built as a project for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree program to display knowledge and comprehension of HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript, while focusing mainly on OOJS. Thank you for playing; I hope you enjoy the game! I have put about 60 hours into it and have done all of my own custom art for this project, of which, I am immensely proud. Thank you, Udacity, for another challenging--yet fun--project!

## Known issues
A couple changes I would eventually like to make is allow the diver to be selected. Right now, the diver is set before the user can choose. I have spent over a week trying to implement this functionality; my mentor advised me to stop working on this and submit for review with the intention of adding this functionality once I understand JS even more. The second change I would like to make is to stop the canvas from running and the user from interacting with it while a modal is open.
